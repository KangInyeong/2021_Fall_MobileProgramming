# 2021_Fall_MobileProgramming
There are 7 questions that have to be solved by using Kotlin.
<br>

# 1. A simple calculator program
I used **"when"** statement to divide calculating case according to each operator and 'else' is used to deal with not +, -, *, and /.
Also, I used **if statement** for the case which has to print "Cannot divide by 0".

# 2. Make array having random numbers
I used **"for"** loop statement to create random numbers and check the duplicated number before the numbers is assigned into the array.
<br>

# 3. Count the number of words of string
I put the string lines into the array named as 'strLine'. And I used **"for"** loop statement to seperate words based on whitespace of each string with using **"split()"**. 
<br>

# 4. Print rotating string
I used **"for"** loop statement to divide the string to two parts by the order, front and back. Then, I connected two parts when complted sentence could be printed.
<br>

# 5. Make class to calcuate average
'Grade' class has three parameters which are math, science, and english. In the class, 'average' function calculates and returns the average of these parameter values.
<br>

# 6. Check palindrome or not
I reversed the string with using **"reversed()"**. Then I compared original string and reversed string.
<br>

# 7. Make class to extend another class
Inheritance class use **"open"** and **"override"** with pair. I can be defined the setter of the parameter such as 'y'. If the setter is not defined, it works automatically.
